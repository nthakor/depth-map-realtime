# Fast feature matching using GPU in video.
The repository is part of the project course ES 611 Programming Advanced Computer Architectures. We are trying to implement feature matching using KDTree on GPU. 

We are using following papers:
* Popov, Stefan, et al. "Stackless KD‚ÄêTree Traversal for High Performance GPU Ray Tracing." Computer Graphics Forum. Vol. 26. No. 3. Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2007.
* Zhou, Kun, et al. "Real-time KD-tree construction on graphics hardware." ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG) 27.5 (2008): 126.

Both the papers are uploaded in the repository.
